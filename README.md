# Video_Classifier_Task using CRNN
Overview:
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) model to classify videos into categories of violence and non-violence. The dataset used for training and validation is the "Real Life Violence Dataset". The code is implemented in Python using libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Keras.

Prerequisites:-
1)Python 3
2)Jupyter Notebook
3)OpenCV
4)NumPy
5)Matplotlib
6)Scikit-learn
7)Keras

Installation:-
i)Clone this repository to your local machine
ii)Navigate to the cloned directory
iii)Install the required dependencies

Dataset:-
i)The "Real Life Violence Dataset" contains videos categorized into "Violence" and "NonViolence" classes.
ii)Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and stored in a directory named "Real Life Violence Dataset" within the project folder.

Usage:-
i)Open Jupyter Notebook
ii)Navigate to the project directory and open the main notebook file: "Video_classifier.ipynb"
iii)Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the video frames, visualize the data, define the CRNN model, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Note:-
i)The The code is divided into sections and commented for clarity.
ii)Adjust hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and model architecture as needed and ensure that the dataset directory structure and file names are consistent with the provided code.
